# Unified Model Zoo for Remote Sensing Change Detection  

We are happy to announce that we are going to release a **unified model zoo** for **remote sensing change detection**.  

## âœ¨ Key Features  
- **Modular and Extensible**  
  The framework is designed with modular components, making it easy to extend and integrate new models or datasets.  

- **Lightweight, No Third-Party Toolbox Dependency**  
  Unlike existing solutions that rely on toolboxes such as *mmsegmentation*, our model zoo is implemented in a clean and lightweight way, with no heavy external dependencies.  

- **Multi-Framework Support**  
  Out-of-the-box support for multiple deep learning frameworks, including:  
  - PyTorch  
  - MindSpore  
  - LuoJiaNET  

## ðŸš€ Goals  
- Provide a unified and standardized platform for remote sensing change detection research.  
- Lower the entry barrier for new researchers and developers.  
- Facilitate fair comparisons and reproducibility across different models and frameworks.
